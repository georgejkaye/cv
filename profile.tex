My clear logical thinking and adaptable approach to problem solving has enabled
me to achieve a First in my Masters degree from the University of Birmingham.
I consistently manage my workload effectively and have the motivation to
complete tasks on time. Moreover, my personable nature means I can work
successfully in a team as well as independently. Currently, my research
interests are in graphical calculi for compositional systems and the lambda
calculus using monoidal categories, and reasoning diagrammatically with graph
rewriting techniques.
